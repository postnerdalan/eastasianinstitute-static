The East Asian Studies Institute is an online-first organization serving
enthusiasts of East Asian languages and cultural topics.

Founded in 2021 by [Alan W](https://captainalan.github.io) as a way to turn a
hobby (studying foreign languages) into something useful for the public, the
East Asian Institute now functions as a hub for international friendship and
scholarship/study.

We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bECGvtAvWX) up and running.
Contact Alan W (president) directly using the contact information at the bottom
of this page.
